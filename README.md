ConsciousCart is an iOS app that enables users to take control of their impulse purchasing habits by stashing away their desires for a later date. Users simply take a picture of the item that might be an impulse purchase and specify the price, category, etc., and a reminder date. The idea is that by waiting to buy the item, the user will execute a more mindful purchase and not buy things they don't really want. Consequently, the user will feel good about purchases made after the waiting period since they are items they really want or need.

When an impulse purchase's specified date arrives, the user will receive a notification asking if they still want to or did already purchase the item. If they don't, the price of the item gets added to their total Money Saved score (good). If they bought the item, the price gets added to their Impulse Spent score (bad).
