    ConsciousCart is my first official iOS app! \
    I'm a self-taught iOS Engineer who has a background in physics. The idea for \
    this app came from my own experience practicing delayed \
    gratification to curb regretful spending. \n
    I want to thank my friends and family for their unwavering support. \
    Without them this wouldn't be possible.
