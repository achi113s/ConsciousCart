    ConsciousCart is my first official iOS app! \
    I'm a self-taught iOS Engineer who has a background in physics. The idea for \
    this app came from my own experience practicing delayed \
    gratification to curb regretful spending. \n
    I want to thank my friends and family for their unwavering support, \
    without whom this app wouldn't exist.
